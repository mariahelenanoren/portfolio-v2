# Web portfolio

A personal web portfolio featuring some of my previous projects, information about myself and my merits.

Built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and a little bit of PHP. The design is simple and clean while small details like a scroll animation on the projects makes the website come to life. The mansonry layout for the portfolio is created using [colcade.js](https://github.com/desandro/colcade).
